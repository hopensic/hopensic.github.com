## LeetCode-1004 题解

### [Leetcode-1004](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)([力扣-1004](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/))

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.
Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s.  

#### Example 1:
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

#### Example 2:
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]

Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

#### Note:

1. 1 <= A.length <= 20000
2. 0 <= K <= A.length
3. A[i] is 0 or 1

#### 题目描述

给定一个数组，其中只包含0或者1。可以把数组中的元素从0变到1，或者从1变到0，一次变换的操作称作一次翻转。给出K，对数组做最多K次的翻转，使数组中连续的1出现的长度最长。

#### 别人优秀题解

```python
def longestOnes(self, A, K):
    i = 0
    for j in xrange(len(A)):
        K -= 1 - A[j]
        if K < 0:
        K += 1 - A[i]
        i += 1
    return j - i + 1
```
